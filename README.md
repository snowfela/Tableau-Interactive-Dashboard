# Tableau Interactive Dashboard Project

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of an **interactive business dashboard** using Tableau Public.  
It uses the **Sample - Superstore** dataset to visualize key performance metrics such as **Sales, Profit, and Profit Ratio** across categories, segments, and geographic regions.

Through this project, I learned foundational Tableau concepts, including:
- Connecting and relating multiple data tables
- Creating maps, charts, and text tables
- Combining views into an interactive dashboard
