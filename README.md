# Tableau Interactive Dashboard Project

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of an **interactive business dashboard** using Tableau Public.  
It utilizes the **Sample - Superstore** dataset to visualize key performance metrics, including **Sales, Profit, and Profit Ratio**, across categories, segments, and geographic regions.

Through this project, I learned foundational Tableau concepts, including:
- Connecting and relating multiple data tables
- Creating maps, charts, and text tables
- Combining views into an interactive dashboard

##Process
1. First, the dataset is imported. 
- has 3 tables (Orders, People, and Returns)
- Order & returns tables are imported with a many-to-many relationship

2. A new worksheet was created for each of the visualizations.


3. Profit ratio is created.

   - created a Level of Detail (LOD) expression to find if the orders are profitable or not
